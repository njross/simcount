To generate the QSP parameters.

======================================================================
Over the Clifford+Rz basis

* For QSP: use QSPCZ.nb. To compute the number of phases required by
  the algorithm choose a value of n (the system size) and evaluate the
  notebook (change the values of lowerbound and upperbound to gain
  efficiency).

* For QSPJA: use QSPJACZ.nb. To compute the number of phases required
  by the algorithm choose a value of n (the system size) and evaluate
  the notebook.

* QSPsegment: use QSPSegmentCZ.nb and QSPAnglesCZ.nb. In
  QSPSegmentCZ.nb choose n (the system size) and evaluate the notebook
  to get the number of segments. Then set n (the system size), alpha
  (the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients), and seg (the
  number of segments) in QSPAngles.nb and evaluate to obtain the list
  of angles.

* QSPsegmentfit: use QSPSegmentfitCZ.nb and QSPAnglesCZ.nb. In
  QSPSegmentfitCZ.nb set n (the system size) and evaluate the notebook
  to get the number of segments. Then set n (the system size), alpha
  (the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients), and seg (the
  number of segments) in QSPAngles.nb and evaluate to obtain the list
  of angles.

Over the Clifford+T basis

* For QSP: use QSPCT.nb. To compute the number of phases required by
  the algorithm choose a value of n (the system size) and evaluate the
  notebook (change the values of lowerbound and upperbound to gain
  efficiency).
  
* For QSPJA: use QSPJACT.nb. To compute the number of phases required
  by the algorithm choose a value of n (the system size) and evaluate
  the notebook.

* QSPsegment: use QSPSegmentCT.nb and QSPAngles.nb. In QSPSegmentCT.nb
  choose n (the system size) and evaluate the notebook to get the
  number of segments. Then set n (the system size), alpha (the sum of
  the absolute value of the coefficients), and seg (the number of
  segments) in QSPAngles.nb and evaluate to obtain the list of angles.

* QSPsegmentfit: use QSPSegmentfitCT.nb and QSPAngles.nb. In
  QSPSegmentfitCT.nb set n (the system size) and evaluate the notebook
  to get the number of segments. Then set n (the system size), alpha
  (the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients), and seg (the
  number of segments) in QSPAngles.nb and evaluate to obtain the list
